      "textCore": "<p>All VIVACY’s products are hyaluronic acid-based. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, particularly in the skin and mucous membranes. It can retain up to 1,000 times its weight in water2, consequently contributing to the hydration and toning of the concerned tissues3.</p><p>HA has a short life span and is soluble in water, meaning it needs to be stabilised before injection into skin tissues. To do so, a special technical process called “cross-linking” is used to bind HA molecules together to obtain a cohesive HA gel for a skin smoothing, lifting and/or volumising effect that will last for several months. The duration of the treatment depends on many factors, such as the patient’s skin type and structure, age, lifestyle, the area treated and the injection technique used by the practitioner.</p>",
