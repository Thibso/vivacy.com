It can retain up to 1,000 times its weight in water<sup>2</sup>, consequently contributing to the hydration and toning of the concerned tissues<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>HA has a short life span and is soluble in water, meaning it needs to be stabilised before injection into skin tissues. To do so, a special technical process called “cross-linking” <sup>*</sup> is used to bind HA molecules together to obtain a cohesive HA gel for a skin smoothing, lifting and/or volumising effect that will last for several months. The duration of the treatment depends on many factors, such as the patient’s skin type and structure, age, lifestyle, the area treated and the injection technique used by the practitioner.</p>",

      "content": "<p>All VIVACY’s products are hyaluronic acid-based. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, particularly in the skin and mucous membranes. It can retain up to 1,000 times its weight in water<sup>2</sup>, consequently contributing to the hydration and toning of the concerned tissues<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>HA has a short lifespan and is soluble in water, meaning it needs to be stabilized before injection into skin tissues. To do so, a special technical process called “cross-linking” is used to bind HA molecules together to obtain a cohesive HA gel for a skin smoothing, lifting and/or volumising effect that will last for several months. The duration of the treatment depends on many factors, such as the patient’s skin type and structure, age, lifestyle, the area treated, and the injection technique used by the practitioner.</p>",

To obtain these desired effects, the HA gel must have a unique combination of elasticity and viscosity<sup>5</sup>. These specific viscoelastic properties determine where the gel will be injected, allowing it to respond to the various mechanical stresses to which it will be subjected in the tissues. As a result, the interpenetration of HA cross-linked networks<sup>4</sup>:</p>    <ul>      <li>Optimizes the products’ rheology, in particular the viscosity to guarantee good product injectability.</li>    <li>Preserves the partial independence of the interpenetrated HA networks, whilst increasing the density of chemical nodes.</li>    <li>Guarantees the cohesion of the HA gel and its monophasic properties.</li>    </ul>",
